{{ guest.group.name }},

{{ c.EVENT_NAME }} encourages performers to sell their merchandise throughout the event.  The best way to do this is to participate in "Rock Island", where our volunteers sell your merchandise at a booth which is staffed throughout the event.  Bands can opt to instead sell from their own dedicated table in the Marketplace if they are will to staff for at least 8 hours per day.  We need you to tell us which option you prefer by filling out the form at {{ c.URL_BASE }}/guests/merch?guest_id={{ guest.id }}

Failing to fill out this form by {{ c.BAND_MERCH_DEADLINE|datetime_local }} forfeits the offer of a dedicated table and may interfere with our ability to accept your merchandise at Rock Island.
